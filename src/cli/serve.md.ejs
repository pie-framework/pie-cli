# serve 
---

Run a server for the pie item. A `pie item` is an item that contains a `config.json` and `index.html` file. Changes to local pie src, `config.json` and `index.html` will be picked up and reload the browser.

Note: For this command to run the build assets need to be present. So after you stop the command these files will be in the directory. To remove them run `pie clean`. We'll add a feature soon to automatically remove them when the server is stopped.

## Options
  
  `--port` - the port to use - default `4000`
  `--no-source-maps` - disable source map generation - default: not set 
<%= loadFile('common-opts.md') %>
  
## Examples
```shell
pie serve --dir ../path/to/dir
```
